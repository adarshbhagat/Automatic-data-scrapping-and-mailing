# Automatic-data-scrapping-and-mailing
In this repo there is a code which will scrap some information from some websites and mail the useful information to my team-mates and all will track the stocks and sectors.
As i am a stock market trader so i need to have some specific information about performing stocks and sectors at the end of every trading session, For this information i need to visit some websites manually and my team members also goes through the same process so to remove this overhead i designed a code which scraps the informations and automatically mail to all my team-members.

Please run this code only in trading day(monday to friday) and after 6PM.
